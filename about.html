        <p class="para">I am Tejashri. I love to bake and experiment in the kitchen. My kitchen is <br> my safe haven and happy place.
            I bake when I am stressed, when I am <br> happy, when I am  tensed and even when I am sad. So, I thought why
            not <br> make money out of it. That was the start of Cafe Brew.. I have always <br> been a huge caffeine consumer;
            drinking coffee after waking up, after <br> going to work, in the meetings, in the evenings, before going to
            bed and <br>anywhere in between. At some point, I realized that I actually couldn't <br> survive without my daily
            dose of coffee and that is where Cafe Brew's <br> tagline comes from.</p>
